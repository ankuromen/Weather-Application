Simple weather app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Weather is obtained from the https://openweathermap.org/ API by entering the city name.
The API returns data statistics for that particular city.
# Run
To run the application clone the repository directly, open the index.html file.
Also, we have to generate a key for the API from https://openweathermap.org/ to run this in your system environment.
After generating, replace my key in the script with your new key.

# Contents

*index.html for basic structure
*script.js for defining working functions.
*style.css for the cosmetics of the application.
